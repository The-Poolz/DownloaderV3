DownloaderV2 is a flexible and reusable .NET library designed for downloading and processing data using a provided database context. The library is intended to be integrated into various projects that require reliable data handling operations.

## Features
- Extensible: Easily integrate with different database contexts by extending the base context (BaseDownloaderContext).
- Simple API: Provides an easy-to-use API for initializing and running data download processes.
- Modular Design: Designed to be modular and easily extendable to fit different data processing needs.
